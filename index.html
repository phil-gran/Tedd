                    <h1>Tips for getting the U-bill sent to you immediately</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Convincing a homeowner to send you their electricity bill right away can be challenging, but with the right approach, you will increase your chances of success. Here are some tips:</p>
                    <h4>Establish rapport:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the time to get to know the homeowner and build a relationship with them. This can help to establish trust and make them more comfortable sharing their electricity bill with you.</p>
                    <h4>Explain the purpose:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain the purpose of the electricity bill and why it is necessary for the solar presentation. For example, you can explain that you need to understand their energy usage patterns in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the potential savings from a solar system.</p>
                    <h4>Emphasize the benefits:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlight the benefits of the solar system and explain how the electricity bill will help you to provide a more accurate estimate of those benefits. For example, you can explain that a detailed electricity bill will allow you to identify areas where energy savings can be maximized.</p>
                    <h4>Offer a solution:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer a solution to any concerns or objections the homeowner may have about sending their electricity bill. For example, you can offer to email the bill securely or to redact any personal information that they may not want to share.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Be persistent:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Be persistent, but not pushy. If the homeowner is not comfortable sending their electricity bill right away, offer to schedule a follow-up call or meeting to discuss it further.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By approaching the situation in a friendly and professional manner, and highlighting the benefits and addressing any concerns the homeowner may have, you will increase your chances of convincing them to send you their electricity bill right away</p>
                </div>

                <div class="argument" id="argument">
                    <h1>Compelling Arguments</h1>

                    <h4>Here is a compelling argument to excite and motivate the homeowner to send their electricity bill right away:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having access to your latest electricity bill is essential in helping you understand your energy usage and how much you will save money on your monthly bills with our solar system. By sending us your latest bill, you'll be empowering us to provide you with personalised energy-saving information that will help you lower your energy costs. It's a simple step that will have a big impact on your wallet.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't miss out on the opportunity to take control of your energy costs and start saving money today. Simply send us your latest bill via text or email, and we'll take it from there. It's quick, easy, and you'll be one step closer to a more energy-efficient future."</p>

                    <h4>Here is a compelling argument explaining how homeowners are paying for other homeowners to go solar, and how it is in their best interest to take advantage of government subsidies and tax benefits:</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners across the country are unknowingly paying for other homeowners to go solar through their monthly utility bills. This is because utilities raise their prices to cover the cost of the subsidies and incentives they provide to homeowners who switch to solar.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But here's the good news: you can take advantage of these same subsidies and tax benefits and put the money you save back into your own pocket. By going solar, you can significantly reduce your monthly energy bills, increase your property value, and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the current government subsidies and tax benefits, there has never been a better time to make the switch to solar. These incentives are designed to make solar energy more affordable and accessible to homeowners, and they can help you save thousands of dollars over the life of your solar panel system.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let your hard-earned money go to waste by paying for others to go solar. Take advantage of these government incentives and start saving money on your energy bills today."</p>

                    <h4>Energy costs are on the rise</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy costs are on the rise, and it’s not a matter of if but  when your monthly bills  will start to skyrocket. The longer you wait, the more you'll be paying for your energy every month. Don't let your hard-earned money go to waste by paying more for your energy than you need to.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;By making the switch to solar energy, you can lock in low energy costs for years to come and protect yourself from the rising cost of traditional energy sources. With solar, you'll be generating your own energy from the sun, which is a free and renewable source of energy that will never run out.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the current government subsidies and tax benefits, there has never been a better time to make the switch to solar. These incentives are designed to make solar energy more affordable and accessible to homeowners, and they can help you save thousands of dollars over the life of your solar panel system.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait until it's too late and your energy bills are out of control. Take control of your energy costs now and start saving money on your monthly bills. Make the switch to solar today and start enjoying the benefits of low energy costs for years to come."</p>

                    <ol style="padding: 15px;">
                        <li>Ask the homeowner if they have access to their electricity bill online or if they have a physical copy of it.</li>
                        <li>If they have access to the bill online, ask them to log in to their account and locate the latest bill.</li>
                        <li>If they have a physical copy, ask them to grab it.</li>
                        <li>Once they have found the bill, ask them to look for the kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption for the last 12 months and the total bill amount.</li>
                        <li>If they prefer to send the bill via text, ask them to take a clear photo of the bill and text it to <span>apricotenergyusa@gmail.com</span>.</li>
                        <li>If they prefer to send the bill via email, ask them to scan and attach the bill and email it to <span>apricotenergyusa@gmail.com</span>  or save the images of the bill or take screenshots of the online bill and email it to <span>apricotenergyusa@gmail.com</span></li>
                        <li>If they are unable or unwilling to send it to you, ask them to tell you their kWh consumption for the last 12 months and the exact bill amount over the phone.</li>
                        <li>Thank the homeowner for their cooperation and inform them that you will be able to assist them better with this information.</li>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <span>Agent</span> from <span>Renewable Energy Program</span>, I'm calling to see if you are interested in installing <span>Solar Panels</span> in order to reduce your electricity bill.
                    <h4>Are you the homeowner?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, I'm glad I found the right person!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have to ask, are you currently paying over $100 on your electric bill?</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: yes, 100+</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, that's a lot of money you're throwing away!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't worry, we can help you save big. Our homeowners who switch to renewable energy are saving anywhere from 30 to 50% with no upfront or installation fees.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, we work hand in hand with your current electricity provider, so it's a win-win situation.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides electricity provider]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we work with them all the time!</p>

                    <h4>Now, I have to ask, how old is your roof?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: 3 years old</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even better! Most of our customers who qualify for our program have a <span>credit score of 600 or above</span>. Is that the case for you?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: <span>Yes</span></p>

                    <h4>Great, and do you get a good amount of sunlight on your roof?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: <span>Yes</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Congratulations, Mr. (Name)! You're pre qualified for our program. We would love to give you a free consultation to show you how you can generate your own electricity and save money at the same time. When's a good time for a virtual meeting this week?</span></p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides availability]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, we'll need you to send a picture or bill copy to (407) 564-0006. And don't worry, the only thing we'll do with your bill is pay it for you! (email if no sms @ APRICOTENERGYUSA@GMAIL.COM)</p>

                    <h4>[IF Homeowner is hesitant about sending bill]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Name</span>, it's for your own good. Our design engineers use a 100 million dollar software to build custom and accurate projects based on your kW usage. Your billing statement will give the expert the data he needs to show you what we can truly do. Plus, this meeting will save you thousands of dollars a year.</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [agrees to send bill]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we'll send you a link for the video call and your email is?</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides email]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, and if we need to reach you, is this the best number to call you back?</p>
                    
                    <h4>Homeowner: [yes / provides phone number]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we have you scheduled for our virtual meeting on (day) at (time). Just to confirm, is this still a good time for you? We want to make sure that we're not interrupting any important plans you might have. Let us know if there's a better time for you and we'll work around your schedule.</p>

                <div id="question6">I absolutely understand. I&#39;m sure you, like myself, are dubious of things that appear too good to be true. Government subsidies enable us to install a solar system for your home at no cost. Keep in mind that you will still be paying an electricity bill, but it will be at a cheaper rate with us instead of your present provider.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <div id="question7">I entirely understand; I've seen some terrible solar installations with massive panels that aren't levelled with the roof. The good news is that this is not what we do at Freedom Forever. We employ smooth, black-on-black panels that complement any roof. We arrange them in a symmetrical pattern and employ a rail-free racking technique, so all you see are the panels.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <div id="question9">
                    <li> I appreciate that, but it appears that THIS is something YOU are interested in. Is your (husband/wife) there now? Would they be willing to talk to me?</li>
                    <li>IF NO: Most people in a similar position make a tentative appointment for when both will be available. That way, you'll have time to talk to your husband/wife first. We will always contact the day before to confirm that you were able to have that discussion.</li>

                <div id="question10">I understand, but given that this is a technical explanation as well as a lasting solution.  We would prefer that you both be present in order to save money and go green. If your partner has any questions We want to make sure we don't miss any queries or concerns and provide both of you the opportunity to be properly educated on solar and our programs.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display11()">11. Solar is too expensive / I can't afford it.</p>
                <div id="question11">
                <li> NJ/NY: What gives you that impression? One of the most common misconceptions about getting solar is this. Getting solar for your home is currently more inexpensive than it has ever been. There are government incentives in place that allow us to do all of the system's engineering, design, and installation for free. You would only save money by using cleaner energy.</li>
                <li>FL/TX: What gives you that impression? One of the most common misconceptions about getting solar is this. Getting solar for your home is currently more inexpensive than it has ever been. Because of the way our program is set up, you can own your solar system simply by swapping your electricity bill for solar payments. The price will be close to what you are currently paying and also save a lot more over time.</li>

                <p type="button" onclick="display12()">12. How do you do this for free?</p>
                <div id="question12">Well, nothing in this world is free! Government incentives enable us to do everything. You will not be charged for the engineering, design, or installation of the system. You're still paying for electricity right now. Through us, you pay a lower, greener rate for your electricity.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display13()">13. Who bills me? Do I get two bills?</p>
                <div id="question13">That is a great question! Since you are still linked to the grid, the electric company will always give you a statement. The good news is that it will show you not only how much electricity you consumed, but also how much you produced. Most consumers appreciate receiving a statement that explains why they are paying close to nothing. The actual electric bill will be substantially lower because of the solar energy you produce.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display14()">14. Not enough savings.</p>
                <div id="question14">I appreciate that monthly savings may not be the primary deciding factor for homeowners. A monthly savings of $40 or $50 will not transform your life...but over time, that savings will amount to THOUSANDS of dollars! That is NOT the ONLY reason people choose solar! Most individuals choose solar to avoid escalating power prices. With solar, we guarantee you a lower rate that will remain low.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display15()">15. We went with another solar company.</p>
                <div id="question15">Excellent! We encourage individuals to get several estimates so they can compare the differences between providers. You are free to continue looking for a better bargain until your panels are installed. Because we deliver the best value to your house, Freedom Forever is the fastest growing solar company in the country. How willing are you to make one last comparison before making that long-term commitment? When can I have our specialist virtually meet with you to talk about our program?<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display16()">16. I'm going to sell my home.</p>
                <div id="question16">I understand why you would not see the value in getting solar if you plan to sell your property. The fantastic thing about our program is that after the panels are placed, you will experience instant monthly savings on your electric cost. Furthermore, even if utility rates continue to climb, you will continue to pay the same low monthly fee until you move out. The solar deal is readily transferable to the new homeowners after your home is sold, and they will also realise instant savings on electricity while avoiding the utility company's growing rates. And the best part is the system adds value to your property and it makes it more attractive to potential buyers.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>
