                    <h4>Opening Spiel</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi this is<span> Agent </span>, from the <span> Renewable Energy Program.</span> I'm calling to see if you are interested in installing Solar Panels in order to reduce your electricity bill.</p>

                    <h4>Are you the homeowner?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, I'm glad I found the right person!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have to ask, are you currently paying over $100 on your electric bill?</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: yes, 100+</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, that's a lot of money you're throwing away!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't worry, we can help you save big. Our homeowners who switch to renewable energy are saving anywhere from 30 to 50% with no upfront or installation fees.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, we work hand in hand with your current electricity provider, so it's a win-win situation.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides electricity provider]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we work with them all the time!</p>

                    <h4>Now, I have to ask, how old is your roof?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: 3 years old</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even better! Most of our customers who qualify for our program have a <span>credit score of 600 or above</span>. Is that the case for you?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: <span>Yes</span></p>

                    <h4>Great, and do you get a good amount of sunlight on your roof?</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowner: <span>Yes</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Congratulations, Mr. (Name)! You're pre qualified for our program. We would love to give you a free consultation to show you how you can generate your own electricity and save money at the same time. When's a good time for a virtual meeting this week?</span></p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides availability]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, we'll need you to send a picture or bill copy to (407) 564-0006. And don't worry, the only thing we'll do with your bill is pay it for you! (email if no sms @ APRICOTENERGYUSA@GMAIL.COM)</p>

                    <h4>[IF Homeowner is hesitant about sending bill]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Name</span>, it's for your own good. Our design engineers use a 100 million dollar software to build custom and accurate projects based on your kW usage. Your billing statement will give the expert the data he needs to show you what we can truly do. Plus, this meeting will save you thousands of dollars a year.</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [agrees to send bill]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we'll send you a link for the video call and your email is?</p>

                    <h4>Homeowner: [provides email]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, and if we need to reach you, is this the best number to call you back?</p>
                    
                    <h4>Homeowner: [yes / provides phone number]</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome, we have you scheduled for our virtual meeting on (day) at (time). Just to confirm, is this still a good time for you? We want to make sure that we're not interrupting any important plans you might have. Let us know if there's a better time for you and we'll work around your schedule.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much, (Name). Have a wonderful day, and we'll talk soon!</p>

The good news is that this is not what we do at Freedom Forever. We employ smooth, black-on-black panels that complement any roof.

                    <li>IF NO: Most people in a similar position make a tentative appointment for when both will be available. That way, you'll have time to talk to your husband/wife first. We will always contact the day before to confirm that you were able to have that discussion.</li>

We would prefer that you both be present in order to save money and go green. If your partner has any questions We want to make sure we don't miss any queries or concerns and provide both of you the opportunity to be properly educated on solar and our programs.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <div id="question11">
                <li> NJ/NY: What gives you that impression? One of the most common misconceptions about getting solar is this. Getting solar for your home is currently more inexpensive than it has ever been. There are government incentives in place that allow us to do all of the system's engineering, design, and installation for free. You would only save money by using cleaner energy.</li>
                <li>FL/TX: What gives you that impression? One of the most common misconceptions about getting solar is this. Getting solar for your home is currently more inexpensive than it has ever been. Because of the way our program is set up, you can own your solar system simply by swapping your electricity bill for solar payments. The price will be close to what you are currently paying and also save a lot more over time.</li>

                <p type="button" onclick="display12()">12. How do you do this for free?</p>
                <div id="question12">Well, nothing in this world is free! Government incentives enable us to do everything. You will not be charged for the engineering, design, or installation of the system. You're still paying for electricity right now. Through us, you pay a lower, greener rate for your electricity.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display13()">13. Who bills me? Do I get two bills?</p>
                <div id="question13">That is a great question! Since you are still linked to the grid, the electric company will always give you a statement. The good news is that it will show you not only how much electricity you consumed, but also how much you produced. Most consumers appreciate receiving a statement that explains why they are paying close to nothing. The actual electric bill will be substantially lower because of the solar energy you produce.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display14()">14. Not enough savings.</p>
                <div id="question14">I appreciate that monthly savings may not be the primary deciding factor for homeowners. A monthly savings of $40 or $50 will not transform your life...but over time, that savings will amount to THOUSANDS of dollars! That is NOT the ONLY reason people choose solar! Most individuals choose solar to avoid escalating power prices. With solar, we guarantee you a lower rate that will remain low.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display15()">15. We went with another solar company.</p>
                <div id="question15">Excellent! We encourage individuals to get several estimates so they can compare the differences between providers. You are free to continue looking for a better bargain until your panels are installed. Because we deliver the best value to your house, Freedom Forever is the fastest growing solar company in the country. How willing are you to make one last comparison before making that long-term commitment? When can I have our specialist virtually meet with you to talk about our program?<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>

                <p type="button" onclick="display16()">16. I'm going to sell my home.</p>
                <div id="question16">I understand why you would not see the value in getting solar if you plan to sell your property. The fantastic thing about our program is that after the panels are placed, you will experience instant monthly savings on your electric cost. Furthermore, even if utility rates continue to climb, you will continue to pay the same low monthly fee until you move out. The solar deal is readily transferable to the new homeowners after your home is sold, and they will also realise instant savings on electricity while avoiding the utility company's growing rates. And the best part is the system adds value to your property and it makes it more attractive to potential buyers.<span type="button" onclick="hide()"> close</span></div>
